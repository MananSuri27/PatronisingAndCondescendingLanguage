# PatronisingAndCondescendingLanguage
Code accompanying my paper [Boosting Pre-trained Language Models with Task Specific Metadata and Cost Sensitive Learning](https://aclanthology.org/2022.semeval-1.63/), at SemEval 2022 colocated with NAACL 2022. This was the solution from PiCkLe for Task 4, Patronising and Condescending Language Detection.

## Methodology
1. Using Pre-trained Language Models
2. Utilising post metadata
3. Using cost sensitive learning to tackle class imbalance.
